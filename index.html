            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class='about'> Growing up I've always been fasicnated by computers. As I got older, I found myself spending more and more time on them. 
                From playing videogames, editing videos, music production and, now, learning to code. My coding adventure began as a hobby in 2021,
                where I worked my way through the foundational and advanced javascript portions of the Oden Project and I fell in love with it. Currently, I am studying at Manchester Codes,
                with the aim of taking my passion for coding into a carear in web development.
