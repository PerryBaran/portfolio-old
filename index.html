            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Perry. I'm 26 years old, was born in Leeds and I'm currently learning web development at Manchester Codes. I have a bacheleor's degree in Nanotechnology 
                (Chemical) (2:1) from the University of Leeds. In my free time I produce electronic music under the name "Jenico", spend too much time playing videogames and enjoy
                bouldering.
            </p>

                I have always been good at problem solving, and spend too much time on a computer anyway, so thought coding would be a great fit! I started learning to code through
                the free coure TheOdenProject and quickly took a liking to it. After completing their foundational course and the Javascript portion of the advanced course I felt I 
                had gained a good base understanding of coding and wanted to take my passion for coding as a hobby into a profession. Manchester Codes came highly recommended to me,
                and seemed like the perfect course to gain that deeper understanding.
            </p>
